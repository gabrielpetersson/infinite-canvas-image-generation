# Open canvas image generation

An experiment I built over the weekend 2023. Uploaded cause a lot of people asked how it's built. It's pretty simple

Try it here! [https://image-generation-ui.vercel.app/](https://image-generation-ui.vercel.app/)

# TODO

- zoom in while editing/isDirty global
- moving image while tmp id is there screws things up?
- add upscales near to image
- change keys to image ids
- change tooltip lib. at least remove the selector
